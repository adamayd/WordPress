# WordPress

This repo contains my personal solutions to courses and tutorials related to WordPress development including plugin, theme, and widget development.  My solutions do not follow the exact path of the courses.  You can look at my solutions for ideas of different solutions or additional functionality, but I would not use them as course starter files.
